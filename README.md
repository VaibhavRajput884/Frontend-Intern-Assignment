# React Todo List App

## Overview

This is a simple todo list application built using React.js. Users can add, delete, and mark todo items as complete. The application is designed with reusable components such as Button, Checkbox, and TodoRow.

## Requirements

- Experience with `React.js` or a willingness to learn.
- Knowledge of `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`.
- Experience with `Git` and `version control`.
- Ability to work independently and complete tasks on time.

## Components

### Button

The Button component (`Button.tsx`) has two variants: `big` and `small`, providing flexibility in design and usage.

### Checkbox

The Checkbox component (`Checkbox.tsx`) includes a checkbox input and a label. The label content is passed as a prop for customization.

### TodoRow

The TodoRow component (`TodoRow.tsx`) combines the Checkbox and Button components. The delete button is visible only on hover, enhancing user interaction.
